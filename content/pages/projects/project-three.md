**A Flawed System**

A recent article in[ *The Australian* ](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/calculation-on-ndis-price-totally-broken-say-providers/news-story/9558dddb5754640087176bc1e1878c9f)highlights a critical flaw in the NDIS pricing model. Providers have raised alarms, stating that the current calculation method is "totally broken." This issue is not just a matter of financial logistics; it directly affects the quality of care and services available to NDIS participants.

Providers argue that the pricing model fails to account for the real costs of delivering services. This shortfall means that many providers are struggling to stay afloat, which inevitably impacts the quality and availability of support services. For participants, this translates into reduced access to essential services, longer wait times, and increased stress and uncertainty.

**The Impact on Our Community**

At Never Limited, we see firsthand the struggles that individuals with disabilities face when trying to access the support they need. The broken pricing model exacerbates these challenges. It’s not just about numbers on a balance sheet; it’s about real people facing real hardships.

The current model doesn’t adequately cover the costs of providing high-quality care. This results in many providers being unable to offer the level of service that participants deserve. The impact is felt across the board – from reduced therapy sessions and inadequate support coordination to insufficient funding for essential assistive technologies.

**Our Call to Action**

We believe that every NDIS participant deserves access to the highest quality of care. To achieve this, it’s crucial that the pricing model is re-evaluated and reformed. We call on policymakers to:

1.  **Engage with Providers**: The insights of service providers are invaluable. They understand the true costs and challenges of delivering care. Policymakers must engage with them to develop a pricing model that reflects reality.

2.  **Increase Transparency**: Participants and providers need clear, transparent information about how prices are set and adjusted. This transparency will build trust and ensure that everyone understands the basis for funding decisions.

3.  **Ensure Sustainability**: The NDIS must be sustainable for both participants and providers. This means setting prices that cover the actual costs of care, ensuring that providers can continue to offer high-quality services without financial strain.

**Our Commitment**

At Never Limited, we’re committed to supporting individuals with disabilities through every challenge. We offer a range of services, including AI training programs, self-advocacy tools, educational support, and more. Our goal is to empower participants to navigate the NDIS and access the support they need.

We also stand ready to advocate for necessary changes in the system. We will continue to raise our voices, alongside those of other providers and participants, to push for a fair and functional NDIS pricing model.
