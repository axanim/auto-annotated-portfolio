At 13, Axel's journey with the NDIS began with Annette fighting for support for Axel's disabilities - Autism and profound intellectual impairment. His initial plan? A meager $3000, just enough for some reports but no real help. Annette, juggling her business and Axel's needs, faced the heartbreaking decision to relinquish him.

Axel's first Christmas away from home was spent in the hospital with a serious injury, leaving a scar from wrist to finger. Two years later, he returned home with a $360,000 plan but in a dire state – obese and later diagnosed with erythromelalgia, a rare pain condition aptly named 'man on fire syndrome.' Annette believes the separation shattered both his health and her spirit.

Years of relentless battles have taken their toll, but today, Axel has a $550,000 plan. The fight is far from over as they continue to seek appropriate Specialist Disability Accommodation and the support needed to avoid restrictive practices. Despite the significant pain he endures, their focus remains on creating an environment that minimizes his suffering and maximizes his quality of life. 

Axel doesn't process pain like we do, and he can lash out, but we must continues to advocate for Axel's needs, he is our mate and you don't give up on your mates when the going gets tough, instead you get tough on the system.
