---
In 2019, Dylan faced some serious mental health challenges. But, like a true warrior, he didn't let that stop him. Fast forward to 2020, and Dylan, living with Autism, embarked on a new adventure by relocating to Hobart to pursue a psychology degree. With a passion for Latin and Ancient History, he absolutely smashed his first year, scoring over 90% in those subjects. His brilliance didn't go unnoticed – the university awarded him a free Bachelor of Philosophy to study alongside his psychology degree.

However, by late 2022, Dylan started feeling the weight of his achievements. The burnout was real, and by 2023, depression had made its unwelcome return. As if dealing with mental health struggles wasn't enough, Centrelink decided to drop a bombshell on Dylan in late 2023. They claimed that his dual-degree subjects were unrelated, accusing him of knowingly doing the wrong thing and slapped him with a $30,000+ debt in Youth Allowance repayments.

> “I wanted to throw myself in front of a train to escape the debt.”

Imagine juggling mental health recovery and academic pressures, only to have a $30,000+ debt thrown into the mix. It was a heavy burden, one that Dylan carried daily, pushing him to the brink. "I wanted to throw myself in front of a train to escape the debt" he confided in us. But thanks to his supportive partner, Dylan found the strength to keep going.

We weren't about to let this injustice slide. We took Dylan's case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, armed with determination and the power of section 1237AAD of the Social Security Act 1991. And guess what? We won! On July 2, 2024, Dylan was finally released from the debt.

This journey hasn't been easy, but Dylan's story is a testament to resilience and the power of fighting back against an unjust system. He's not just a survivor; he's a champion, proving that with the right support and determination, we can overcome even the toughest battles.

So here's to Dylan – a true inspiration, showing us all that we can stand up, fight back, and win.
