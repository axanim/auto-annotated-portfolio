In today's digital age, access to data and technology has become a powerful tool for empowering individuals and transforming lives, particularly for people with disabilities. The World Development Report 2021, "Data for Better Lives," highlights how data can enhance economic performance, improve public policies, and help individuals make better decisions.

At Never Limited, we believe in the potential of data and technology to bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive society. Our mission is to leverage these tools to empower people with disabilities, enabling them to lead more independent and fulfilling lives.

### The Power of Data

Data is a double-edged sword with the potential to drive significant positive change when used responsibly. The report outlines several ways in which data can be harnessed to foster development and improve lives:

*   **Enhanced Economic Performance:** Data-driven insights can help businesses optimize operations, leading to increased productivity and economic growth.

*   **Better Public Policies:** Governments can use data to design, execute, and evaluate policies more effectively, ensuring resources are targeted where they are needed most.

*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Individuals and communities can make better choices when they have access to accurate and timely information.

### How We Use Data and Technology

At Never Limited, we utilize data and technology in various innovative ways to support people with disabilities:

*   **NDIS Navigator GPT:** Our AI-powered tool helps individuals navigate the complexities of the NDIS, ensuring they receive the support they need.

*   **Self-Advocacy Tools:** We provide resources to help individuals write complaints, prepare for reviews, and communicate their support needs effectively.

*   **Educational Support:** Our AI tools act as research assistants, helping individuals enhance their writing, understand subjects better, and improve their study habits.

*   **Government Communication:** By providing real-time answers and guidance, our tools assist in effective communication with government agencies.

*   **No-Code Platforms:** We enable individuals to create powerful applications with automation and AI bots, making technology accessible to everyone.

### Bridging the Digital Divide

The World Development Report emphasizes the need for equitable access to data and technology, which is essential for creating a level playing field. Major inequities exist in the ability to produce, utilize, and profit from data, particularly among marginalized groups. At Never Limited, we are committed to addressing these disparities by providing training and resources to empower people with disabilities.

By teaching individuals how to use generative AI (GAI) tools effectively, we help them overcome challenges and unlock new opportunities. Our advocacy for telehealth Medicare appointments further ensures that health services are accessible to those with behavior concerns and intellectual impairments.

Access to data and technology is a game-changer for people with disabilities, offering unprecedented opportunities for empowerment and inclusion. At Never Limited, we are dedicated to harnessing the power of these tools to improve lives and build a more equitable society. Together, we can leverage data for better lives and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
