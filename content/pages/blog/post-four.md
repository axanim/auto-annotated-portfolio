My lived experience "behaviour of concern" is all part of the pain experience in someone who cannot cognitively process what pain is.

"Those living with a disability who are unable to reliably communicate their pain are one of the most vulnerable groups for undetected or misidentified pain.



> Research shows that individuals living with a disability are at a higher risk of experiencing pain and having more frequent or severe pain1.

> Those who are unable to communicate their experience of pain may also have less access to appropriate and adequate pain management2."
