"The NDIS is a $30 billion industry to the Australian government. 36% of those children in the NDIS have a diagnosis of autism but the research behind neurodevelopment and autism is very poor"

"You see on average children wait 3½ years from the time caregivers notice a delay to the point of getting their assessment. 88% of caregivers know there is a concern by the time children start school but can’t get a neurodevelopment assessment. We need to change the science. We need to change the practices behind how we do assessments and provide supports to families. It’s a national emergency."

A NATIONAL emergency [Bill Shorten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-shorten-5464b7b7/)
NOT a STATE one.

"One of the things that Dr Gordon talked about and I’ve heard repeatedly is the future of science really is about data. It’s really about the quality of the data that we can collect."

"So the question is: how can we develop markers that better assess neurodevelopmental delay without getting caught up necessarily in a specific diagnosis?"

"We’ve been using eye-tracking methodologies to understand how that practice might impact on learning and development and might also predict child neurodevelopmental delays."

> we can differentiate between a neurodevelopmental diagnosis with 90% accuracy immediately at the point of an interaction

"We’re using algorithms developed by AI to generate these skills independently. And what we’ve been able to show is that, by using things like joint attention and eye gaze and facial movement, we can differentiate between a neurodevelopmental diagnosis with 90% accuracy immediately at the point of an interaction. And this means that families will get answers in the future about delays for their children and their interactions faster than ever before. And now we’re using these data to guide how we refer families and children into different therapies."

"We’ve been looking at how our children learn in their social environment, if you like — engage in social learning over time using these data collection algorithms so that if children don’t respond to the immediacy of therapy, we can use biological or targeted therapies to increase their response. We can make sure that children get what they need out of therapy using biosignals."

You don't need to be a neuroscientist to understand from reading this - a cookie cutter approach to therapy does not work.

There are innovative ways we can improve therapy delivery and outcomes. Scientific ways that don’t put more work onto the carer.

The importance of data and Application of AI for adults, particularly those with intellectual disability, must surely flow through.
