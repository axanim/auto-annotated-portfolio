    "bio": "Hey there! Iâ€™m Annette, reach out to me for all things accessibility and disability advocacy. With a diverse background in corporate IT, peer mental health and Access Consulting, Iâ€™m on a mission to make the world a more inclusive place, one policy at a time.\n\nWhen Iâ€™m not advocating for change or juggling complex PTSD with a smile, youâ€™ll find me knee-deep in cloud computing, turning data into actionable insights. I am currently back at uni studying a Masters in Software Engineering(AI) so everyone can call me Master. Oh, and did I mention? Iâ€™m also a proud mum to three incredible kids, with an array of disabilities, my daughter is besties with her dog, Lucy. My dog Gracie is a Kippet (Kelpie x Whippet) and we live with a ragdoll cat, \"The Great Catsby\", who throws lavish parties.\n\nLetâ€™s connect and make some noise for disability rights â€“ because fighting the system is what I do for kicks! ðŸš€\n",
